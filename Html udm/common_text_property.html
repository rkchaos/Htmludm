    <h1>Cutter fish</h1>
    <p>Cuttlefish or cuttles[2] are <a href="hero">marine</a>  molluscs of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda which
        also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which
        is used for control of buoyancy.

        Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with
        which they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest
        species, the giant cuttlefish (Sepia apama), reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in
        mass.</p>

    <h2>Fossil record</h2>
    <p>The earliest fossils of cuttlefish are from the Cretaceous period.[6][7] represented by Ceratisepia from the Late
        Maastrichtian-Paleocene.[8] Whether the earlier Trachyteuthis is assigned to this order, or to the
        Octopodiformes, remains unclear.</p>

    <h2>Range and habitat</h2>
    <p>The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and temperate ocean waters. They are mostly
        shallow-water animals, although they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).[10] They have an
        unusual biogeographic pattern; they are present along the coasts of East and South Asia, Western Europe, and the
        Mediterranean, as well as all coasts of Africa and Australia, but are totally absent from the Americas. By the
        time the family evolved, ostensibly in the Old World, the North Atlantic possibly had become too cold and deep
        for these warm-water species to cross.[11] The common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), is found in the
        Mediterranean, North and Baltic seas, although populations may occur as far south as South Africa. </p>
