    <div>A republic (from Latin res publica 'public affair') is a form of government in which "supreme power is held by
        the people and their elected representatives".[1] In republics, the country is considered a "public matter", not
        the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained
        through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by
        any given family lineage or group. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a
        monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.</div>
